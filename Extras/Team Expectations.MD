<h1>Team Expectations: Team “Git Gu(i)d”</h1>


<h3>Lead: Joey Tong


Architect: Austin Ford


UI: Connor Cummings


Design: Anthony Olivares</h3>


<b>Check the skype daily:</b> this is where meetings will be planned, held, and most conversations will be done in the skype group.


<b>Seek help when help is needed:</b> Don’t be a hero. If you don’t understand something and/or can’t meet a deadline, you don’t need to sit there for 13 hours trying to solve it on your own. You also shouldn’t miss the deadline without telling anyone. Reach out to me (Joey), Prof. Bierre, or a TA for help.


<b>Work on the game daily:</b> Even if it is only for ten minutes, it is important that you at the very least check in every day to make sure the code and progress isn’t so far above your head that you feel you can no longer contribute. 


<b>Comment your code and describe your changes:</b> This is straightforward. Comment the code you write and describe any changes made every time you push to the github on the README.MD file.


<b>Communicate with your teammates:</b> If you wrote or changed any code that will impact someone else’s work, first, comment that code. Second, describe your chances in the github README. Third, tell that team member what you changed, why you changed it, and how to use it. If there is a case where you cannot understand code and no comments or changes are written anywhere, reach out to the team member yourself.  


<b>Consider the weekly deadlines a bare minimum:</b> If you have a 3 hour slot of free time, don’t just do your required work and call it quits. The more we do early, the more we can implement into the game to make it actually enjoyable.


<b>Speak up:</b> If there is something aspect of the game you disagree with, speak up and state your reasoning. There is no way of knowing if you have a good or better idea if you never say it.
