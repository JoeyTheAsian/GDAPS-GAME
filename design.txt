Levels (ideas/general layout impression):
###########
-Streets: Large open area without much cover, enemies can enter from buildings along the sides of the street. Will branch out into various alleyways and sidestreets with varying levels of cover/openness. Cover objects could include trash cans, cars, etc.

-Parking garage: Large rooms with sparse cover in the form of infrequently placed cars. Cars could possibly explode after taking too much damage. Can share trash cans, concrete, cars, etc. with streets level.
