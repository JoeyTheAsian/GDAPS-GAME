-*Riot geared: move at half the speed and fire rate of the player, have 8 health. ( wear stolen riot gear, as the name implies - carrying a shield in one hand )
-*Mob leaders that are like normal enemies but use the tommy gun, have 5 health. ( the fact they use a tommy gun should be reflected in the sprite, they can wear an old-school business suit with a fedora )

-Flamethrower guys whose name is exactly what they do.

-A melee variant of the riot-gear enemy type.
-Slow enemy type that use deadly sniper rifles.

Story:
###########
The main character is John Kinder, a detective in the big city of Longdale. When his hometown of Goldcrest falls under the control of a huge crime ring that kills his wife, he goes back to take revenge and save the town. 
Story:
Level 1 - Streets
The detective is driving into town when some mobsters open fire on his car, having know he was 
coming. He is forced to get out of his car and head into town on foot.

-Game Intro (text):
(Main character narrating by talking into recorder)
"It seemed simple at first. We had all heard the rumors. That Goldcrest - my hometown, just 45 minutes away from my workplace in the Longdale Police Department - had something going on. Something big. No one knew it would turn into this."
"We lost contact with Goldcrest's police force 8 hours ago. Since then, 2 investigation teams were sent in and they've gone dark now too."
"I'm not supposed to be heading over. I'm technically off duty. But I can't stand by while this happens. My wife is still at home."
"This may be the last anyone hears of me. Detective John Kinder, signing off." 


###########
Levels:
###########
-Streets: Large open area without much cover, enemies can enter from buildings along the sides of the street. Will branch out into various alleyways and sidestreets with varying levels of cover/openness. Cover objects could include trash cans, cars, etc.

-Parking garage: Large rooms with sparse cover in the form of infrequently placed cars. Cars could possibly explode after taking too much damage. Can share trash cans, concrete, cars, etc. with streets level.



###########
Other level ideas (would require new assets):
###########
-Library: Detective could come here looking for information. Would be composed of large rooms divided into narrow passages by bookshelves, giving a lot of horizontal cover but not much room to move around in and leaving player open to attacks from enemies in the same row of shelves.

Required assets: Bookshelves, interior floor/carpeting texture, maybe a desk object



###########
Assests (that would be required for currently confirmed levels)
###########
-concrete texture for sidewalks
-asphalt / road lines
-cars
-building fronts / top-down view rooftops
-trash cans
-dirt lot floors
-fencing
-dumpsters
