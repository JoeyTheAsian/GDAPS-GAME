<b>4:27 am 2-6-16: Joey Tong</b> <ul><li> Implemented FPS tracking, Entity class</li>
<li> added Character & Projectile Entity children classes</li>
<li> added Coord (coordinate) class and Map class</li>
<li> Created Developer's Console (windows console)</li>
<li> Added "NoTexture.png" texture and loaded to content</li>
<li> Implemented autosize window</li>
<li> Set game refresh rate to 120hz</li>
<li> Removed placeholder "sm.png" texture</li></ul>
<b>10:55PM 2-6-16: Joey Tong</b> <ul><li>Fixed FPS tracking issue where it was tracking game logic refresh rate instead of fps</li>
<li> added "ConcreteTexture.png" and loaded asset to content</li>
<li> partially implemented Map class and sloppily rendered a bitmap with no objects onto the game window</li>
<li> continued implementation of Entity child classes</li>
<li> Stress tested game rendering, maxes out at about 500 entities on screen while maintaining constant 55 fps and 120 hz game refresh rate</li>
<li> <b>Known Issue: frame rate is locked to about 55 and not very well optimized, we should consider unlocking</b></li></ul>
